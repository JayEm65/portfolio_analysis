## About the Project

This project is centered on analyzing financial data, with the goal of evaluating a set of assets, computing various financial metrics, and optimizing portfolios. Youâ€™ll work through tasks involving data analysis, machine learning for portfolio optimization, and visualization of financial trends. 

### Key Areas:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Working with financial datasets to clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Using tools like Matplotlib and Plotly to create interactive charts for financial data analysis.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Analyzing risk-return trade-offs and optimizing portfolios using techniques like Markowitz's Efficient Frontier.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (for data analysis and modeling)
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (numerical computing)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (data visualization)
- **Plotly** (interactive visualizations)
- **scikit-learn** (machine learning for predictions and optimizations)
- **yfinance** (fetching financial data from Yahoo Finance)

## Project Tasks
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Import financial datasets and clean the data for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze asset prices, returns, and correlations.

**Portfolio Optimization:** Apply methods to optimize a portfolio, considering risk and returns.

**Visualization:** Generate plots and interactive charts to represent financial trends and portfolio performance.
